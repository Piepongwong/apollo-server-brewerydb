            description: "The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company was established in 1980 by homebrewers Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi. Camusi retired in 1998 and sold his share in the company to Grossman.\r\n\r\nLocated in Chico, California, Sierra Nevada Brewing is one of the most popular craft breweries currently operating in the United States. Its Pale Ale is world renowned, and the brewery produces almost 700,000 barrels of beer per year. Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is the second best-selling craft beer in the United States, behind the Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams Boston Lager.\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada's specialty brews include the winter seasonal Celebration, which is similar to the pale ale, but hoppier; and Summerfest, a lager which is citrusy and sunny.",
